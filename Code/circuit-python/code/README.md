# Welcome Circuit Python!

Using curcuit python is really easy. The main code file is always called code.py and the bees3.py is a helper library to make accessing the boards RGB LED and Battery Voltage Monitoring really easy. 

All you have to do is drag the bees3.py onto your CIRCUITPY drive and the code.py from one of the example folders onto the drive and it will start running right away!

No compiling or terminal commands to get it running. its just drag and drop!
